h2. Screen Maps - Page Objects on steroids

Screen Map is a design pattern for functional tests that extends the idea of a page object pattern by making page objects
aware of navigation.

h3. Traditional Page Objects

Page object pattern has the following traits:

* Each page represented using an object
* Every UI element represented using private methods or fields
* Sometimes, the interactions possible on a page are exposed as methods on the object

h3. Screen Maps

Typically, in applications, navigation between pages in a business scenario is quite common. This can be modelled into the
functional test suites by using the Screen Map pattern.

Extension to the Page object:

* Creating a new page object navigates to that page
* Any action that navigates to a page is done in a method which returns an object of that new page
* The returned object's creation does not navigate. Instead, it validates that the browser is in fact pointing to this page

h3. Why Screen Maps?

It emphasizes on *DRY* and on exposing interactions as behaviour on page classes. Modeling a user's scenario as page transitions
is very useful. It becomes quite natural in terms of writing code and reusing code.

This is very powerful because adding a new test would involve knowing the right screen to start with and then knowing what
interaction takes to another screen etc. This way, you are completely mimicking exactly what an end user does.
